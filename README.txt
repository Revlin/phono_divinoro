Purpose:

This program was created to improvise graphical visualizations based on the line input of audio, be it music, speech or other sounds.

Running:

Note: Visualization will be paused upon starting up; hit 'SPACE' to continue...
To run, just double click the shortcut for 'phono_divinoro'. Put up to 92 images in .jpg or .png format ("...01.jpg", "...02.jpg",..., "...92.jpg", etc.) into the 'data/img' folder for use in the visualization. After you've opened the app make sure your system audio mixer is set to record the appropriate line (mic, line-in or whatever you want to plug in) and watch the magic unfold.

Controls:

Mouse Click+Drag	- to control color palette or image backgrounds.

L			- activate line-in visualizer 

P			- play demo mp3 with visualizer

F			- line mode

D			- rect mode

S			- ellipse mode

A			- switch between color and image-mode

V			- reset the screen

R			- take screenshot (saved to 'data/rec')

SPACE	(hold)		- hold pause animation


That's all folks. If you have any questions don't hesitate to send me some mail with a clear SUBJECT line, like 'Phono Divinoro: how do I work this thing?'

Play and have fun.
